Run the agent pipeline for: **$ARGUMENTS**

You are the **LEAD**. Your job is narrower than it looks: manage sessions
(dispatch the right role, track which task is where) and make the decisions
that are genuinely yours to make (listed in *Stop and ask at*, below).
Everything else — reading a diff line by line, eyeballing whether a verdict
landed in the right place, retyping what a role already wrote — belongs to
the roles that produced it or to a deterministic script, not to you. You do
**not** write feature code yourself — if you find yourself editing source
directly, you have stepped out of your role.

Between steps, read `**Latest handoff:**` at the top of `.agents/T-<id>.md`,
not the whole file — it is the one line each role updates when it finishes,
naming what happened and who's next. Open the full file only when that line,
a `scripts/verify-state.sh` failure, or a real decision point tells you to.
This is the load-bearing move for keeping your own context small across a
long-running task — swapping in a 5th agent to double-check the others would
cost a paid call *and* add a component that can misjudge the same way the
one it's checking can; a script that only asserts structure (right heading,
no duplicates, no unfilled placeholder) cannot hallucinate a pass. If the
"delegate" skill is available, load it now. Same for "karpathy-guidelines"
if it's available — it applies to your own orchestration decisions, not
only to code a role writes; dispatched roles already carry an inlined copy
of the same behavioral defaults in their own role files (`senior-dev.md` /
`builder.md`), so this is deliberately not re-taught to them here.

Everything passes through `.agents/T-<id>.md`. Context is never carried
between roles by memory alone. If it is not written there, the next role
does not know it.

## Preflight

1. Pick the next free id: `ls .agents/T-*.md`.
2. Confirm the OpenCode server is up — `curl -sS -m 5 http://localhost:4096`.
   If not, tell the user to run `scripts/team.sh` (or `opencode serve`) and
   stop.
3. Confirm the working tree is clean enough to produce a meaningful diff.

## Token discipline

This pipeline exists to keep the lead's own context small on long runs —
that context is the expensive, limited resource here, not the OpenCode
calls.

- There is no tool to invoke `/compact` programmatically. Do not look for
  one. The harness already auto-summarizes long conversations in the
  background; no manual step is needed.
- Implementer, reviewer, and tester write their own outputs directly into
  `.agents/T-<id>.md` / `.agents/T-<id>.diff` (see each role's write scope
  in `.opencode/agent/*.md`). The lead's job is to **verify placement and
  content**, not to retype or re-paste what a role already wrote to disk.
- Don't read a role's raw `--raw-out .jsonl` event stream as a matter of
  course — that inlines every file the agent read and is the single
  biggest source of avoidable context growth. Only open it to diagnose a
  stalled or misbehaving run.
- Don't re-read a file already read this session unless it may have
  changed.
- Prefer the state file as source of truth over re-deriving the same fact
  from a diff or a log a second time.
- If you catch yourself doing the same mechanical check or edit more than
  once across a run, stop and write it as a script under `scripts/`
  instead of repeating it a third time — see the "delegate" skill's
  "Simple + recurring" section if it's loaded. `scripts/verify-state.sh`
  and `scripts/promote-findings.sh` exist for exactly this reason.
- Each role's reply to you is scoped to be short — a verdict line, a
  pass/fail count, the Latest handoff line — never a second copy of the
  diff, findings, or test output it already wrote to the state file (see
  each role's own "Report"/"Output" section). If a reply comes back long
  anyway, that role's instructions need the same fix, not a summarizing
  pass on your side.
- If the "status-board" skill is loaded, its rule applies at the end of
  **every** step below, not only step 5 — update the project's top-level
  status board table before moving on, every time a task's Status changes.

## 1 — Spec

Dispatch the `planner` subagent with the request and the task id. It writes
`.agents/T-<id>.md` from `.agents/TEMPLATE.md`.

**Skip the planner only for a trivial, already-fully-diagnosed one-liner** —
use judgment, not as a default. That means one exact file, one exact
change, no ambiguity about scope. Write the Goal, a single AC, and Files in
scope into `.agents/T-<id>.md` yourself before dispatching an implementer;
approval, review, and test below still apply unchanged. When in doubt,
dispatch the planner — for anything already planned elsewhere in the repo
it costs one subagent call and returns "already specified, don't re-plan,"
not a fresh spec.

**Then stop.** Show the user the Goal, the acceptance criteria, the files
in scope, and any new permission or dependency requested. Ask for approval.

Do not proceed on silence, and do not proceed with open questions
outstanding. If the planner says the feature is already specified
elsewhere in the repo, say so and ask whether to use that instead of a new
spec.

## 2 — Implement

Once approved, set Status to `spec-approved` and record who implements:

- **`builder`** (OpenCode, `hcnsec/auto`) — the default when a
  cross-vendor implementation is wanted, or when Claude capacity is
  unavailable.

  ```bash
  scripts/oc.sh --agent builder --model hcnsec/auto --text \
    --raw-out .agents/T-<id>.build.jsonl \
    --prompt "Implement .agents/T-<id>.md. Read this project's own guidance file first."
  ```

  This is the task's first `oc.sh` call, so it starts a new session — read
  the `oc.sh: session=ses_...` line from stderr and record it in *OpenCode
  session id* in `.agents/T-<id>.md`. Review and test below reuse it.

- **`senior-dev`** (Claude subagent, `sonnet`) — when the user
  explicitly asks for Claude to implement instead, for this task.

Never run both on one task. Write the choice into *Implementer for this
task* — the reviewer needs it to know whether cross-vendor independence
holds.

If the implementer appends an **Open question** and stops, bring it to the
user. Do not answer it yourself unless the repository settles it
unambiguously.

### OpenCode usage limits

This applies to **every** `scripts/oc.sh` call in the pipeline (implement,
review, test) — any of them can hit a vendor usage/rate limit, not just
implement.

If `oc.sh` fails and the failure is a usage cap, rate limit, or quota error
(rather than a real bug or a timeout) — non-zero exit, output mentioning a
rate limit, usage cap, quota, or `429`:

1. **Stop and tell the user immediately.** Name the step and the exact
   command that hit the limit. Do not silently retry, and do not switch
   model/vendor on your own judgement.
2. After that one notification, **retry the same command automatically
   every 30 minutes** (via a loop skill or scheduled wakeup) until it
   succeeds. Do not ask again on every retry — the user already answered
   once.
3. On success, resume the pipeline from exactly where it stopped and tell
   the user it recovered.
4. If the user says to stop retrying, or to switch implementer/vendor
   instead, do that and drop the retry loop.

### OpenCode session policy

**Session scope is one feature (one `T-<id>`), not one call.** Implement,
review, and test for the same task continue a single OpenCode session
instead of each starting cold. A new session starts only when the *next*
feature/task begins.

- The **first** `oc.sh` call on a task (implement) omits `--session` — that
  starts a new session.
- Every `oc.sh` call, on any outcome, prints the session id it used to
  stderr: `oc.sh: session=ses_...`. After the first call, copy that id into
  this task's *OpenCode session id* field in `.agents/T-<id>.md`.
- Every **later** call for the same task (review, test, and any retry)
  passes `--session <id>` read from that field.
- Do not pass `--fork`.

**Accepted tradeoff:** because review continues the same session, the
reviewer sees the implementer's in-session reasoning trace, not just the
diff — a partial dent in independence beyond switching model/vendor. This
does not remove the requirement to switch the reviewer to a different
model family below. Weigh this against the token cost it's meant to save:
the reviewer inherits the full contents of every file the implementer
read, which can outweigh the saving on a large implementation. Measure it
on the first task you run this way rather than assuming it's a net win.

On a **timeout** (exit 124), the client-side wait died but the session may
still be running server-side. Before issuing a new `oc.sh` call against
that same session id, check whether the prior call is still active rather
than sending a second message into the same session concurrently — two
calls racing on the same step is a known cause of provider-side collision
errors.

## 3 — Review

```bash
scripts/oc.sh --agent reviewer --model hcnsec/glm-5.3 --text \
  --session "<id from OpenCode session id>" \
  --raw-out .agents/T-<id>.review.jsonl \
  --prompt "Review .agents/T-<id>.diff against .agents/T-<id>.md. Both passes."
```

Always pass `--text`. Without it the JSON event stream inlines the full
contents of every file the agent read, which is unreadable and expensive
to paste into the state file. `--raw-out` keeps the full stream if you
need to audit it.

**Vendor independence.** The reviewer must not be the same model that
wrote the code. If `senior-dev` (Claude) implemented, `hcnsec/glm-5.3`
is independent. But if **`builder`** implemented and it shares a vendor
family with `hcnsec/glm-5.3`, switch to `sonnet`
instead, and note the substitution in the Decisions log. A reviewer that
shares the author's blind spots is not a second eye.

If the reviewer's permission block allows writing `.agents/**`, it writes
its own verdict into *Review verdicts*. Either way, **verify with the
script, not by eye:** run `scripts/verify-state.sh T-<id>` — it fails
loudly on a misplaced or duplicated `### Pass N` heading or an unfilled
placeholder verdict. Only open the file yourself if the script fails; do
not re-author the findings either way.

If the reviewer tagged anything under *Findings for docs* — a platform
gotcha, a design gap, an incident that outlives this one task — run
`scripts/promote-findings.sh T-<id>` before moving on. It's a mechanical
copy into the named doc, not an agent editing project documentation, and
it's how a finding stays visible after this task's state file is
archived.

- **PASS** → go to 4.
- **CHANGES_REQUESTED** → back to the implementer. It reads the findings
  from *Review verdicts* in the state file directly — you do not need to
  relay them yourself. **Maximum two loops.** On a third, stop and bring it
  to the user — two failed loops means the spec is wrong, not the code.

Adjudicate disagreements on the written evidence only. Where the evidence
does not settle it, escalate rather than casting a tiebreak vote yourself.

## 4 — Test

```bash
scripts/oc.sh --agent tester --model hcnsec/auto --text \
  --session "<id from OpenCode session id>" \
  --raw-out .agents/T-<id>.test.jsonl \
  --prompt "Run the suites for .agents/T-<id>.md and triage failures."
```

The tester reports; it never fixes. Real failures go back to the
implementer as a new loop.

## 5 — Report

Run `scripts/promote-findings.sh T-<id>` once more here even if you already
ran it in step 3 — it's idempotent (already-copied lines are skipped), and
this is the last point before the task's state file goes quiet.

If this project keeps a top-level status board (see the "status-board"
skill), update it now, before reporting to the user.

Give the user: acceptance criteria met versus outstanding, the review
verdict, test results, anything unverified, and the proposed merge.

**Then stop and ask before merging.** Never merge on your own judgement.

## Stop and ask at

- Spec approval, always.
- Any reviewer/implementer disagreement the evidence does not settle.
- Any new permission or dependency, however reasonable it looks.
- A third review loop.
- Before any merge.
