# Deterministic structural checks on a task state file — the replacement
# for "the lead reads the whole file and eyeballs it" and for "dispatch a
# verifier agent." Neither of those is what you want here: eyeballing costs
# lead context on every single hop, and a verifier agent costs a paid call
# per hop *and* can misjudge the same way the role it's checking can. A
# script that only asserts structural facts (right heading, no duplicates,
# no unfilled placeholder) can't hallucinate a pass — it either matches or
# it doesn't.
#
# This is deliberately narrow: it catches shape problems (the T-01 incident
# this exists because of — a verdict landed as a duplicate heading outside
# Review verdicts), not correctness of the content. Content is still the
# reviewer's and the lead's job.
#
# Usage: scripts/verify-state.sh T-01
# Exit 0 = structurally sound, prints one OK line.
# Exit 1 = specific problems printed to stderr, one per line.
