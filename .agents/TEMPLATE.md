# T-<id> — <short title>

> The spine of the pipeline. Every role reads this file and appends to it.
> **Nothing is passed between roles by prose alone.** If a fact is not
> written here, the next role does not know it.
>
> Copy to `.agents/T-<id>.md` and fill in. Never delete another role's
> section.

**Status:** draft | spec-approved | in-progress | in-review | changes-requested | testing | done
**Owner right now:** planner | senior-dev | builder | reviewer | tester | lead
**Implementer for this task:** senior-dev (claude/sonnet) | builder (hcnsec/auto)
**OpenCode session id:** none yet — set after the first `oc.sh` call, reused for every later call on this task
**Review loop count:** 0 / 2
**Latest handoff:** <one line, overwritten by whichever role finishes last —
`<role> → <outcome in a few words> → next: <role>`. This is what the lead
reads between steps instead of the whole file; open the full file only when
this line, or `scripts/verify-state.sh`, says something needs a look.>

## Goal

<One paragraph. What the user actually wants, in their terms. Not a
solution.>

## Acceptance criteria

> Checkable statements only. "Works well" is not checkable. A statement that
> names an exact input and an exact observable output is. Only the planner
> writes these. **No other role may edit them.**

## Constraints

> From this project's own guidance file unless stated otherwise. Restated
> here so no role has to remember them.

- Surgical changes only. Every changed line traces to this Goal.
- No new runtime dependency unless this task explicitly calls for one.

## Files in scope

> The planner sets this. The implementer may not touch a file outside it
> without appending to Open questions first and stopping.

| File | Why |
| --- | --- |
| | |

## New permissions required

> Any new manifest permission, API scope, credential, or dependency, with
> justification. Empty is the expected answer. The reviewer treats a silent
> addition as an automatic CHANGES_REQUESTED.

| Permission / dependency | Why it is unavoidable |

## Decisions log

> Append-only. Date, role, decision, and the reason. A decision without a
> reason is not a decision, it is a preference.

## Review verdicts

> Written by the reviewer only. PASS or CHANGES_REQUESTED, then numbered
> findings with file:line and severity.

### Pass 1 — <date> — verdict: <PASS | CHANGES_REQUESTED>

<findings, or "none">

## Test results

> Written by the tester only. Never edits source; reports and triages.

### Run 1 — <date>

## Findings for docs

> Any role may append a line here when something learned in this task is
> true beyond this task — a platform gotcha, a design gap, an incident, a
> constraint someone will hit again. Format, one per line:
>
>     - [docs/SOME-DOC.md] one-line finding, self-contained
>
> `scripts/promote-findings.sh T-<id>` copies these verbatim into the named
> doc when you run it (idempotent — already-present lines are skipped). No
> role is ever granted write access to `docs/` directly; this is a
> deterministic copy, not an agent editing project documentation.

## Open questions

> Any role may append. **The implementer must stop when it adds one here.**
> Only the lead clears them.
